## A simple git guide for Programming Design[^1][^2] students.

In this project, students would learn how to use and why should use git to control and save their projects, especially when working with others. We anticipate that this guide might be helpful when students are working on their final project, which could improve their productivity.

This guide includes a slide and some codes, and since Programming Design is a C++ programming course, we thus design this simple C++ project. Each students will solve some very simple problems in each different header files, and practice using simple git command such as `add`, `commit`, `pull`, and `push`. They could also learn how to create new **branch** and **pull request** to contribute to this project.

To make this project more entertaining, if the accuracy of students' work in the header files is high enough, a delicious doughnut animation[^3] will appear, or a failure message, otherwise.
