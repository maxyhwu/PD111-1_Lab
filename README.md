# PD111-1_Lab
## A simple git guide for IM1003[^1][^2] students.

In this project, students would learn how to use and why should use git to control and save their projects, especially when working with others. We anticipate that this guide might be helpful when students are working on their final project, which could improve their productivity.

This guide includes a slide and some codes, and since IM1003 is a C++ programming course, we thus design this C++ project. Students could solve some very simple problems in different header files, and practice using simple git command such as `add`, `commit`, `pull`, and `push`. They could also learn how to create **pull request** and contribute to this project.

To make this project interesting, if the accuracy is high enough, a delicious doughnut animation will appear[^3], and a failure message, otherwise.
